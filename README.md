# OpinionX Browser Extensions

The primary goal of this project is to create custom browser extensions for Safari, Firefox, Edge, and Chrome that utilize public panels of web browsing behavior to answer public opinion-based research questions rapidly and cost-effectively. The cross-disciplinary research team will leverage advanced machine learning algorithms and secure multiparty computation (MPC) to passively observe and interpret web browsing activity, while ensuring an unparalleled level of privacy protection for panelists. The architecture will provide geographically fine-grained measures of public opinion on a variety of topics and issues.

# WebExtensions API
WebExtensions API is a framework that allows developers to write code that can work across different browsers. By using this API, developers can create extensions that can be used not only on Firefox but also on other popular browsers such as Chrome, Edge, and Safari. This makes it easier for developers to reach a wider audience with their extensions.

# Customization 
The browser extension developed for Christenson Dino will be customized to add features that are relevant to his work and research. For example, it may include tools for organizing and analyzing information, highlighting important text, or adding notes to web pages. By using this extension, visitors to Dino's website can have a better browsing experience and access useful features that are tailored to their needs.

This project demonstrates the power of technology to create personalized and efficient tools for users. By developing a custom browser extension for Christenson Dino, we can provide him with a tool that is specific to his needs, making it easier for him to accomplish his work and research. The extension can also benefit visitors to his website by providing them with useful features and tools to enhance their browsing experience.
