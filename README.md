# OpinionX A Privacy Preserving Browser Extension

#Introduction
This project aims to create a browser extension that can help users customize their browsing experience on the internet. Browser extensions are small programs that add new features to a web browser such as Firefox, Chrome, Edge, and Safari. This project specifically targets Christenson Dino, a faculty member at Washington University in St. Louis, and aims to develop a custom extension that is tailored to his needs.

#Web Browser Extensions
Browser extensions are useful tools that can add extra functionality to web browsers. For example, some extensions can block annoying ads or pop-ups, while others can translate web pages into different languages or help users manage their passwords. Browser extensions can be installed easily and can provide a seamless browsing experience for users.

#Project Goals
The primary goal of this project is to create a custom browser extension for Christenson Dino. The extension will be based on WebExtensions API, which is a way of writing code that can work across different browsers. The extension will be designed to provide features that are specific to Dino's work and research, making it easier for visitors to his website to navigate and access useful tools.

#WebExtensions API
WebExtensions API is a framework that allows developers to write code that can work across different browsers. By using this API, developers can create extensions that can be used not only on Firefox but also on other popular browsers such as Chrome, Edge, and Safari. This makes it easier for developers to reach a wider audience with their extensions.

#Customization 
The browser extension developed for Christenson Dino will be customized to add features that are relevant to his work and research. For example, it may include tools for organizing and analyzing information, highlighting important text, or adding notes to web pages. By using this extension, visitors to Dino's website can have a better browsing experience and access useful features that are tailored to their needs.

Conclusion

This project demonstrates the power of technology to create personalized and efficient tools for users. By developing a custom browser extension for Christenson Dino, we can provide him with a tool that is specific to his needs, making it easier for him to accomplish his work and research. The extension can also benefit visitors to his website by providing them with useful features and tools to enhance their browsing experience.
